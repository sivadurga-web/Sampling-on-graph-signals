# Sampling-on-graph-signals
Abstract
This project proposes sampling theory for graph signals that are supported on directed or
undirected graphs. With the proposed sampling theory, perfect recovery is possible for the
bandlimited graph signals from its sampled signal. Designing the sampling operator using
optimal sampling operator and random sampling operator for different graphs. We will
show how to handle full band graph signals by using graph filter banks.
